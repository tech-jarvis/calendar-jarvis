# Contributing

If you would like to begin contributing to Calagator, you should follow a workflow that looks something like the steps below.

    1. Work on the project in your own for. For info on how to do that, see [this](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
    2. For each feature you work on, work in a fresh branch of your fork. So, if you're working on improving test coverage for a specific file **and** implementing something new, they would each have their own branch. To learn about branching and how it works in GitHub, go [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/).
    3. Once you've finished and tested your work, [create a Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#initiating-the-pull-request), explain what your work does, and reference the original ticket if that is relevant. You should be able to do this simply by typing the ticket number into the Pull Request UI.
    4. Once you submit your Pull Request, Travis CI will begin running and ensure your code is compatable. Results will automatically be reported back to your PR when complete. The goal is for all the tests to pass and for overall test coverage to not decrease.
